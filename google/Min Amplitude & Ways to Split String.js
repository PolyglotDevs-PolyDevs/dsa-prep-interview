Question 1:
Given an Array A, find the minimum amplitude you can get after changing up to 3 elements. Amplitude is the range of the array (basically difference between largest and smallest element).



Example 1:

Input: [-1, 3, -1, 8, 5 4]
Output: 2
Explanation: we can change -1, -1, 8 to 3, 4 or 5
Example 2:

Input: [10, 10, 3, 4, 10]
Output: 0

Question 2:
Given a string S, we can split S into 2 strings: S1 and S2. Return the number of ways S can be split such that the number of unique characters between S1 and S2 are the same.

Example 1:

Input: "aaaa"
Output: 3
Explanation: we can get a - aaa, aa - aa, aaa- a
Example 2:

Input: "bac"
Output: 0
Example 3:
